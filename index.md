# Small Projects
Check out [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) for the source of inspiration for many of these projects.

+ [Fractal Tree](fractal-tree)
  + Generates more branches for every mouse click
+ [Perlin Noise Flow Field](perlin-noise)
  + Creates a vector field based on 2D perlin noise and accelerates semi-transparent particles across the screen.
+ [Cellular Automata](cellular-automata)
  + A fun simulation to watch, can you figure out what the colored orbs do?
+ [Floating Island](grass)
  + Intended to become a composition of poetry and a 3D scene, but p5 is too limited. A final version may be created with three.js in the future.
+ [Points and Lines](points-2d)
  + Creating visuals similarly found in video games and other contemporary science fictions.
+ [Glitch](glitch)
  + Playground for adding vaporwave / glitch effects to visuals and DOM elements

# Further Questions and Challenges
+ An n-th digit formula for Pi. [pindex](pindex)
+ An assembly program that uses a function to generate more code as time progresses. [insint](insint)
+ Cryptography with multiple decrypting methods and encrypting methods capable of being solved with a stolen private key, rencrypted but distorted as a backup plan to stolen keys
+ Create a program that takes an image and makes a single sine wave period that represents that image. Then make a robot (program) that can identify images, recognize trigger objects (like a ball or food) and encode them as that sine wave, and play the sine wave continually to generate a single tone. Another robot can hear, decode, and visually process the same image in order for group dynamic to function
