# p5.js Sketches
A composition of p5 sketches with inspiration from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).

+ [Fractal Tree](fractal-tree)
  + Generates more branches for every mouse click
+ [Perlin Noise Flow Field](perlin-noise)
  + Creates a vector field based on 2D perlin noise and accelerates semi-transparent particles across the screen.
+ [Cellular Automata](cellular-automata)
  + A fun simulation to watch, can you figure out what the colored orbs do?
+ [Floating Island](grass)
  + Intended to become a composition of poetry and a 3D scene, but p5 is too limited. A final version may be created with three.js in the future.
