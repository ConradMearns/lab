# Small Projects
Check out [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) for the source of inspiration for many of these projects.

+ [Fractal Tree](fractal-tree)
  + Generates more branches for every mouse click
+ [Perlin Noise Flow Field](perlin-noise)
  + Creates a vector field based on 2D perlin noise and accelerates semi-transparent particles across the screen.
+ [Cellular Automata](cellular-automata)
  + A fun simulation to watch, can you figure out what the colored orbs do?
+ [Floating Island](grass)
  + Intended to become a composition of poetry and a 3D scene, but p5 is too limited. A final version may be created with three.js in the future.
+ [Points and Lines](points-2d)
  + Creating visuals similarly found in video games and other contemporary science fictions.
+ [Glitch](glitch)
  + Playground for adding vaporwave / glitch effects to visuals and DOM elements

# Further Questions and Challenges
+ Can you create a pi indexing function, p, such that p(i) = the numeric value of of pi, who's position was that many digits away from the ones place (i for this index)? The function should be able to calculate this value for any index. For example, pi = 3.1415926... so p(0) = 3, p(3) = 1, p(5) = 9, p(3424732432) = ???
+ Cryptography with multiple decrypting methods and encrypting methods capable of being solved with a stolen private key, rencrypted but distorted as a backup plan to stolen keys
+ An assembly program that uses a function to generate more code as time progresses. [insint](insint)
+ Create a program that takes an image and makes a single sine wave period that represents that image. Then make a robot (program) that can identify images, recognize trigger objects (like a ball or food) and encode them as that sine wave, and play the sine wave continually to generate a single tone. Another robot can hear, decode, and visually process the same image in order for group dynamic to function
